## 👋 About Me

I’m an AI Engineer and educator with 1.5 years of experience training LLMs and diffusion models, and over two years as a full-stack developer. As a part-time professor and research assistant at Humber College, I’ve built custom chatbots, pre-trained large models with LoRA/Dreambooth, and guided students through hands-on AI projects.

## 🚀 Projects Showcase

Below are the AI-agent projects I conceived and built solo, demonstrating deep expertise in modern frameworks and end-to-end pipelines.

### 1. [Travel Advisor AI Agent](https://github.com/sagarvaiyata/travel-advisor-adk-agent)

**Tagline:** A conversational assistant that plans trips, suggests itineraries, and books flights/hotels using Google’s ADK.
**Tech Stack:** Google ADK, Dialogflow, Cloud Functions
**Summary:** Leverages ADK’s built‑in planning modules to manage multi-step dialogues, integrates real‑time flight/hotel APIs, and deploys on Cloud Run for auto‑scaling.

### 2. [RAG Chatbot (Google ADK + Streamlit)](https://github.com/sagarvaiyata/rag-application-adk)

**Tagline:** Retrieval-Augmented chatbot with vector search and live UI.
**Tech Stack:** Google ADK, Streamlit, FAISS, Python
**Summary:** Combines ADK’s RAG utilities with FAISS-powered embeddings, wrapped in a Streamlit interface for rapid prototyping and demo.

### 3. [RAG Chatbot (LangChain + Streamlit)](https://github.com/sagarvaiyata/rag-application-langchain)

**Tagline:** Lightweight RAG-powered assistant built on LangChain.
**Tech Stack:** LangChain, Streamlit, OpenAI API, FAISS, Python
**Summary:** Modular pipeline using LangChain chains and agents, supporting custom prompt templates and local vector store for offline capability.

### 4. [Real Estate AI Agent](https://github.com/sagarvaiyata/ai-langchain-agent)

**Tagline:** Property search and recommendation bot with LangChain.
**Tech Stack:** LangChain, FastAPI, Docker, Python
**Summary:** Integrates LangChain’s planner agent with property database queries; features interactive maps, budget filters, and PDF report generation.

### 5. [PaperWatch AI Agent](https://github.com/sagarvaiyata/ai-autogen-agent-paperwatch)

**Tagline:** Automated research assistant for fetching ArXiv papers.
**Tech Stack:** Microsoft AutoGen, Python, PlayWright, Google Custom Search
**Summary:** Uses AutoGen for orchestrating multi-step retrieval, scraping, and summary generation; deploys as serverless functions for cost efficiency.

### 6. [AI Reporting Application](https://github.com/sagarvaiyata/incident-report-app)

**Tagline:** Intelligent incident-reporting platform with automated insights.
**Tech Stack:** Angular, Flask, OpenAI API, Docker
**Summary:** Frontend in Angular connects to Flask API that processes user-submitted incidents through LLM for generating structured reports following specific organizational formats.
